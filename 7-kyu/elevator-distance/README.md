You have travelled a total of 3 + 6 = 9 floors of distance.</p><p>Given an array representing a series of floors you must reach by elevator, return an integer representing the total distance travelled for visiting each floor in the array in order. </p><pre><code>// simple examples[5,2,8] =&gt; 9[1,2,3] =&gt; 2[7,1,7,1] =&gt; 18// if two consecutive floors are the same,//distance travelled between them is 0[3,3] =&gt; 0</code></pre><p>Array will always contain at least 2 floors. Random tests will contain 2-20 elements in array, and floor values between 0 and 30.</p>
